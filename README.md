# Stock-Trading-Portal

It is a website to trade virtual stocks and shares.
The Actual Price of the shares was parsed from yahoo finance (through their API).

Features of the portal include selling, buying and quoting stocks and viewing history of all the transactions that we made.

This site was designed using Model View Controller architecture.
It was a part of Problem Set 7 of CS50 Cource which i completed in 2016.
